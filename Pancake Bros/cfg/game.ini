- Melee Weapons
- These weapons are charged when the player holds down the attack button.
- The weapon does "DamageAmt" damage each strike, plus a portion of the
- "ChargeDamageFactor" depending on how charged the weapon is.
- 
- Class: WeaponMelee
- AirAttackExtent: Size of hit area when used in an air attack.
- AttackExtent: Size of hit area when used in a ground attack.
- ChargeDamageFactor: Extra damage imparted by charge.
- ChargeKnockbackFactor: Extra knockback imparted by charge.
- ChargeMaxTime: Time needed for the weapon to reach full attack strength.
- SquashExtent: Size of hit area used to find heads to squash.

- Ranged Weapons
- 
- Knockback is usually not necessary, the projectile will impart force through physics.
- Although, you can give him a little "z" knockback to lift him off the ground.
- Mostly, modify ProjectileMass instead.
- 
- Class: WeaponRanged
- ProjectileClass: C++ class of projectile spawned (you shouldn't need to modify this).
- ProjectileGravity: Multiplier, affects gravity force.
- ProjectileAnim: Animation category used for the weapon's projectile (each projectile is a category).
- ProjectileElasticity: How bouncy the projectile is.
- ProjectileMass: Mass of the projectile.
- ProjectileKillTime: Time before projectile destroys itself.
- ProjectileKnockdown: If true, knocks the character down when it hits;
- ProjectileRange: Range in screen units of the projectile, i.e. 1 = 1 screen width in range
- ProjectileSize: Radius of the projectile's bounding sphere.
- ProjectileSpeed: Speed at which the projectile is launched.
